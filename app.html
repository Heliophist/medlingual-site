    <h2>App</h2>
    <p>My app, MedLingual, allows users to choose from English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, or Hindi—the five most spoken languages in my district—and then take or upload a picture of their medication. The app uses AI to identify the medication and retrieves important details such as usage and warnings from the OpenFDA database, translating them into the user’s language.</p>
    <p>I was inspired to create the MedLingual app after noticing how many people in my community, including family and friends, struggle to understand over-the-counter (OTC) medications due to language barriers.</p>
    <p>I also wanted to help my mom with this app. Her vision is worsening, which makes it hard to read small fonts on medication bottles. That’s why I added a feature to increase the font size for better readability.</p>
